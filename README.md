# 🔩 Improved Joint Design – CAD Model

## 📄 Overview
This repository contains an improved version of a mechanical joint designed using **Onshape**. The goal was to enhance the **durability** and **strength** of the joint based on the original design, while **maintaining key dimensions** as specified.

## 🛠️ Work Done
- Modified the geometry of the original joint to **increase mechanical integrity**.
- Focused on **reducing potential stress concentrations** and **improving load distribution**.
- Ensured that the **critical dimensions were preserved** according to provided constraints.

## 🧪 Next Steps
- Perform **FEA simulation** to evaluate stress distribution, deformation, and potential failure zones.
- Compare results with the original design to quantify improvements.
- Present findings in the upcoming design review session.

## 📌 Notes
- No simulation (FEA) has been conducted yet — this is the **geometry/modeling phase only**.
- Design is ready for testing and feedback.
